This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris using Java. It provides a basic command-line interface for playing the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this Tetris game, you will need:

- Apache NetBeans 19
- Java Development Kit (JDK 21) installed on your system
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tetris-java.git
```
If you want to open and run your Java project using NetBeans, follow these steps:

1. Open NetBeans:
Launch NetBeans on your computer.

2. Open Your Project:
In NetBeans, go to File > Open Project...
Navigate to the directory where your Tetris Java project is located and select the project folder. Click "Open Project."

3. Configure the Main Class:
Right-click on your project in the Projects panel (usually on the left side of the NetBeans window).
Select "Properties" from the context menu.
In the Project Properties window, go to the "Run" category.
In the "Main Class" field, specify the main class of your Tetris game (usually Tetris). Make sure it's the class with the main method.
Click "OK" to save the changes.

4. Compile and Run:
Now, you can simply click the "Run Project" button (usually a green triangle) in the NetBeans toolbar, or you can use the keyboard shortcut (commonly F6).
NetBeans will compile your project and run it, executing the main class you specified.
That's it! NetBeans will compile and run your Tetris game for you, and you can play it within the NetBeans environment.

How to Play
Use the A and D keys to move the Tetrimino left and right.
Press the W key to rotate the Tetrimino.
Use the S key to drop the Tetrimino faster.

The goal of the game is to complete lines by filling them with Tetriminoes. Completed lines will be removed, and you earn points. The game ends when Tetriminoes reach the top of the playfield.
